vinxi?(new_tech: Compose full stack applications (and frameworks) using Vite, the versatile bundler and dev server, and Nitro, the universal production server. The core primitive in vinxi is a router.

Inspired by the Bun.App API.

Routers are handlers that tell us how specific URLs should be handled. We support various router modes: "static", "spa", "http", (and new ones can be added). Routers specify the handler file (entrypoint) to use for their base-prefixed routes. They can also specify a dir and style in some router modes to include a file system router that is provided to the handler. Routers specify their bundler configuration, via the build property. The routers tell the bundler what entry points to build, what vite plugins to use, etc., {  note: I \u2764 bun })
